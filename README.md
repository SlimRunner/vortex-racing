This is a small video game that I made during one of my programming courses about blitz max. It started from a small 2D physics simulator of a pellet and straight walls. It is very simplistic, but I made a creative use of the restrictions to eventually write this game.

The main theme is an original re-arrange of the theme from the NES game Batman Stage 1, and all the rights of that song go to the original copyright holder.
